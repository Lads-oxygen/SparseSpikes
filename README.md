# Super-Resolution of Pointwise Sources via the Beurling LASSO

This repository contains the implementation and experimental results for my Master's dissertation on the super-resolution of pointwise sources. The project focuses on recovering sparse discrete measures from blurred and noisy observations using the Beurling LASSO (BLASSO) framework. Additional post-dissertation work explores homotopy methods for the BLASSO.

The repository includes all scripts used to generate the figures in the reports/poster.

## Dataset

The SMLM experiments use data from the publicly available [EPFL Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) Challenge](https://srm.epfl.ch/) dataset.
